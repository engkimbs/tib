Customer must duplicate unaltered copies of all proprietary notices incorporated in or affixed to any Protected Materials. Except as stated in the Agreement, Customer receives no other rights to use any of Licensor's Marks.

	5.	Confidentiality. 
		a) Neither party shall disclose Confidential Information to any third party without the disclosing party's prior consent. Confidential Information may only be disclosed to individuals that need to know such information, and on the condition that the individual is subject to a written agreement to protect information with terms as protective as this Agreement. For the purposes of this section, the definition of Licensor and Customer includes Affiliates of either party. Licensor may use data collected during the Term in an aggregated, anonymized form, provided that such data is aggregated from more than one customer and does not identify Customer, Customer employees, or Customers' customers.
		b) The duty to protect Confidential Information does not apply to information that is shown to be: 
			i. available to the public other than by a breach of a confidentiality obligation; 
			ii. rightfully received from a third party not in breach of a confidentiality obligation; 
			iii. independently developed by one party without use of the Confidential Information of the other;
			iv. known to the recipient at the time of disclosure (other than under a separate confidentiality obligation); 
			v. produced in compliance with applicable law or court order, provided the other party is given reasonable advance notice of the obligation to produce Confidential Information (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the disclosing party's cost, if the disclosing party wishes to contest the disclosure. 
		c) Each party shall indemnify the other for any damages (including reasonable expenses) the other may sustain resulting from a breach of this Section. Money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for a breach of confidentiality. If either party breaches the confidentiality obligations, the non-breaching party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief without the necessity of posting a bond even if otherwise normally required. Such injunctive or equitable relief is in addition to all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity. 
		d) Confidential Information remains the sole property of the disclosing party; except for rights explicitly granted in the Agreement, the receiving party does not acquire any rights to such Confidential Information.

	6.	Data Protection and Back-up.  
		a) If Customer exposes Licensor to an individual's Protected Data, Licensor will process and store such information pursuant to Licensor's Information Security and Compliance Program found at https://terms.tibco.com/#security-guidelines, which includes Licensor's Data Processing Terms that apply when Licensor processes Protected Data on behalf of Customer that is subject to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (EU/2016/679) (GDPR). 
		b) Except when Licensor stores Customer data in connection with the delivery of a Cloud Service, Customer is responsible for backing-up its data and under no circumstances is Licensor responsible for the protection, loss, destruction, or maintenance of Customer's data.

	7.	Indemnity.
		a) Licensor shall, at its own expense, defend or at its option, settle, any claim or action brought against Customer to the extent it is based on a claim that the Software, or Materials, all as updated by Licensor and used in accordance with the Agreement, infringes any patent, copyright, or any trade secret of a third party. Furthermore, Licensor will indemnify and hold Customer harmless from and against damages, costs, and fees reasonably incurred (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that are attributable exclusively to such claim or action and which are assessed against Customer in a final judgment. Licensor's obligations to defend, settle, or indemnify Customer are subject to (i) Customer promptly notifying Licensor in writing of such claim; (ii) Licensor having the exclusive right to control such defense and/or settlement; and (iii) Customer providing reasonable assistance (at Licensor's expense) in the defense thereof. Customer shall not settle any claim, action or proceeding without Licensor's
prior written approval.
		b) Licensor shall not defend, INdemnify, or hold customer harmless for any claim IF: (a) CUSTOMER MADE modifications to the Software OR Materials or portions thereof; (b) such claim would have been avoided by use of the then current release of the Software made available to Customer; (c) Customer continued ITS allegedly infringing activity after being provided with modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement; or (d) such claim is BASED ON Customer's Output.
        c) IF LICENSOR Defends or settles an infringement claim arising under section 7.a above, Licensor's liability and Customer's sole and exclusive remedy (IN ADDITION TO THE "INDEMNITY") shall be for Licensor at its own expense, to either (a) repair, replace or modify the affected Software or re-perform the affected Consulting Services or (b) alternatively, procure for Customer the right to continue to use the affected Software or Materials.  If the foregoing remedies are not commercially feasible (in the reasonable opinion of Licensor), Licensor may (i) cancel the applicable Order form and, as applicable, for the AFFECTED Software refund the license fees and any unearned maintenance fees paid to Licensor by Customer for the affected Software, or (ii) for Consulting Services refund all amounts paid to Licensor by Customer for the affected Consulting Services.

	8.	Warranties.
		a) Licensor warrants that for 90 days following the Delivery Date ("Warranty Period"), the Software, as updated and used in accordance with the Documentation, will operate in all material respects in conformity with the functional specifications described in the Documentation.
		b) Licensor is not responsible for any claimed breach of any warranty caused by: 
			i. modifications made to the Licensor Software by anyone other than Licensor; 
			ii. the combination, operation or use of the Licensor Software with any items that are not permitted in the Documentation; 
			iii. Customer's failure to use any new or corrected versions of the Licensor Software made available by Licensor; 
			iv. Licensor's adherence to Customer's specifications or instructions; 
			v. Customer deviating from the Licensor Software operating procedures described in the Documentation; or 
			vi. Errors caused by customizations. 
			Consulting services to correct defects or issues subject to one of the above warranty exclusions may be procured by Licensee under a Work Order pursuant to Licensor's standard time and material charges.
		c) If the Licensor Software does not perform as warranted during the Warranty Period, Licensor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct Errors. Customer shall promptly notify Licensor in writing of its claim within the Software Warranty Period.  Provided that such claim is determined by Licensor to be Licensor's responsibility, as Customer's exclusive remedy for any warranty claim, Licensor shall, within 30 days of its receipt of Customer's written notice, (i) correct such Error; (ii) provide Customer with a plan reasonably acceptable to Customer for correcting the Error, or (iii) if neither (i) nor (ii) can be accomplished with reasonable commercial efforts from Licensor, then Licensor may terminate the affected Licensor Software license and issue Customer a refund of the license fees paid for the affected Licensor Software. The preceding warranty cure constitutes Licensor's entire liability and Customer's exclusive remedy for Licensor's breach of the warranty stated herein. 
		d) EXCEPT AS STATED ABOVE, LICENSOR, ITS LICENSORS, WEBHOST, DATACENTER AND SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING (i) ANY WARRANTY THAT ANY SOFTWARE, MATERIALS OR SERVICES ARE ERROR-FREE, ACCURATE OR RELIABLE OR WILL OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR THAT ALL ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED OR WILL COMPLY WITH ANY LAW, RULE OR REGULATION (ii) ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT AND (iii) ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING FROM STATUTE, COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE.  LICENSOR CANNOT AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE PRIVACY, SECURITY OR AUTHENTICITY OF ANY INFORMATION SO TRANSMITTED OVER OR STORED IN ANY SYSTEM CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET.

CUSTOMER ASSUMES ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SELECTION OF THE SOFTWARE and OTHER PRODUCTS or SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER TO
ACHIEVE CUSTOMER'S INTENDED RESULTS. Except for the excluded matters, in no event shall either party's total liability to the other for all claims arising out of or as a result of the AGREEMENT exceed the greater of 1,000,000 USD or the fees paid by Customer to Licensor under the applicable Order Form.

    10. Export. Software, Cloud Service, Documentation, Materials, and related technical data are subject to U.S. export control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Act and its associated regulations and may be subject to export or import regulations of other countries.

Notices should be sent to the other party's general counsel or legal department, unless another recipient is expressly identified.
		b) The non-prevailing party shall pay all reasonable costs, including attorney's fees, incurred by the prevailing party in any action brought to enforce the prevailing party's rights under this Agreement.
		c) This Agreement does not create an agency or consignment relationship, and neither party is a partner, employee, agent or joint venture partner of, or with, the other.
		d) During the term of any Order Form and for a period of one year following termination of an Order Form, neither party shall actively solicit for employment any employee, contractor, consultant, or other representative of the other party who performed services in connection with the applicable Order Form, without the prior written consent of the other party.
		e) Licensor may designate any agent or subcontractor to perform such tasks and functions to complete any services covered under this Agreement, provided, however, that Licensor shall remain responsible for performance of its duties under the terms of this Agreement.
		f) During the term of any Order Form and for a period of one year following termination of an Order Form, Licensor and its independent auditors, at Licensor's expense, may audit Customer's compliance with this Agreement upon 10 days' notice and at reasonable times and report any results to Licensor's licensors. Customer shall, at no cost to Licensor, (i) provide any assistance reasonably requested by Licensor or its designee in conducting any such audit, including installing and operating audit software, (ii) make requested personnel, records, and information available to Licensor or its designee, and (iii) provide such assistance, personnel, records, systems access, and information to facilitate the timely completion of such audit. Customer's failure to comply with the provisions of this section will constitute a material breach of this Agreement. If the audit reveals any noncompliance, Customer shall reimburse Licensor for the reasonable costs and expenses of the audit (including but not limited to
reasonable attorneys' fees), and Customer shall promptly cure any such noncompliance; provided, however, that the obligations under this section do not constitute a waiver of Licensor's termination rights and do not affect Licensor's right to payment for Software or Materials related to usage in excess of the Number of Units.
        g) Upon reasonable written notice of at least 3 months and not more than once per year, Customer may (1) audit Licensor's systems, processes, or facilities to determine compliance with this Agreement, (2) or request Licensor's assistance to provide or update information processed by Licensor on behalf of Customer, provided that (i) Customer pays a minimum fee of $50,000.00 for an engagement that may last up to 2 days (and $25,000 for each additional day thereafter), (ii) the audit takes place in an onsite or virtual audit environment performed on Licensor's hardware (i.e., a Licensor controlled computer) and the Customer's personnel (including auditors) are accompanied and/or supervised by TIBCO's representative at all times, (iii) soft or hard copies of data displayed during the audit will not be sent electronically or otherwise transported away from Licensor facility, and (iv) certain highly sensitive data such as Licensor customer information, Licensor employee personal data, and information
regarding Licensor's vulnerability is held in strict confidence and must not be shared with any individual that does not need to know such information.
        h) A waiver by a party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of continuing or succeeding breach.
        i) Performance under the Agreement will be postponed automatically if a party is prevented from performing by any act of or failure to act by the other party.  No delay or default in performance of any obligation by either party (except payment obligations) will constitute a breach of the Agreement if caused by force majeure or any other cause which is beyond its reasonable control, including, fires, strikes, accidents, governmental action or regulatory changes, or acts of God.
		j) Except for an assignment, in whole or part, by Licensor to an Affiliate, neither party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, and/or any of its rights and/or obligations without the prior written consent of the other party, which will not be unreasonably withheld.  Any such attempted assignment is void. For the purposes of the foregoing, a change in control of Customer is deemed to cause or attempt to cause an assignment of the Agreement, in whole or part, and requires Licensor's prior written consent.
		k) If Customer or its successors or assigns enters into an Extraordinary Corporate Event after an Order Form Effective Date, those users, divisions, or entities that were added to or divested from Customer's organization as a result of the Extraordinary Corporate Event are not authorized to use the Software or Materials until those users, divisions, or entities are added to this Agreement by way of a written amendment signed by duly authorized officers of the Licensor and Customer, or in the case of a divesture, the divested entity.
		l) This Agreement is for the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns, and does not confer any rights or benefits on any third party, including any employee of a party, any client of a party, or any employee of a client of a party. Notwithstanding the above, the parties acknowledge that all rights and benefits afforded to Licensor under this Agreement apply equally to the owner of any Third Party Software, and such third party is an intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement.
		m) If Customer is entering into the Agreement from a European Union member country, Norway, Switzerland, Japan, India or Australia, then the Agreement is governed by the laws of Ireland and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland.  Otherwise, the Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Federal Court for the Northern District Court of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to this Agreement.
		n) If any sentence, clause, or other provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under applicable law, including, but not limited to, any limitation of liability, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining clauses and provisions are not affected or impaired. The parties shall interpret the affected provision in a manner that renders it enforceable while attempting to closely approximate the intent and the economic effect of the affected provision.
		o) If any terms and conditions of the Master Terms conflict with the Documentation, then such license requirements or notices pertaining to Third Party Software included with the Software will control. Any conflict between the terms of the Agreement will be resolved in the following order for precedence: (i) Order Form; (ii) Exhibits, (iii) Master Terms.
        p) The Agreement constitutes the parties' entire agreement relating to its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, agreements, or understandings between the parties relating to its subject matter. No modification to the Agreement will be binding unless in writing and signed by each party, except in the case of an Order Form where Licensor's acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on Licensor's initial delivery of products or services under the Order Form. All pre-printed or standard terms of any Customer purchase order or other business processing document shall have no effect.
